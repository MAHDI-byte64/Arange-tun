// Picking up a changed configuration without being told to.
//
// Editing a tunnel's file used to do nothing at all until somebody restarted
// the service. That is a small thing when you remember, and a genuinely
// confusing one when you do not: the file on disk says one thing, the running
// tunnel does another, and nothing anywhere reports the disagreement. The
// panel's own editor works around it by restarting the unit itself, which only
// covers edits made through the panel — an ssh session and a text editor, which
// is how most of these files actually get changed, is left with a tunnel that
// quietly ignores what it was told.
//
// So the file is watched, and a change is applied by stopping the tunnel and
// starting it again with the new configuration, in the same process. What that
// buys over restarting the unit is not speed; it is that the operator does not
// have to know to do it.
//
// Two properties matter more than the feature does, and both are about not
// making things worse than the manual restart was:
//
//   - A file that does not parse is ignored, loudly. A half-saved file or a
//     typo must never take a working tunnel down — that would turn a mistake
//     the operator would have seen immediately into an outage they find out
//     about later.
//   - A file whose contents mean the same thing is ignored silently. Touching
//     a file, rewriting it identically, or editing a comment is not a reason
//     to drop every connection the tunnel is carrying.
//
// The file is polled rather than watched through the kernel. It costs one stat
// every couple of seconds, which is nothing next to what the tunnel is already
// doing, and it avoids a dependency; it also handles the way editors actually
// save — writing a new file and renaming it over the old one — which watching
// an inode does not, without extra care.

// configPollInterval is how often the file is checked. A few seconds is well
// inside "it just picked it up" for a human editing a file, and the check is a
// single stat.
const configPollInterval = 2 * time.Second

// portSettleTimeout bounds how long to wait for the stopped tunnel's ports to
// come free before starting the new one anyway.
const portSettleTimeout = 5 * time.Second

// fingerprint is a cheap identity for the file's current contents. Size and
// modification time together are enough to notice an edit; anything they miss
// is caught on the next edit, and a false positive costs only a parse and a
// comparison, which is why this does not need to hash the file.
