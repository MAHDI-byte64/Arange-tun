// Which source ports the pck carrier's segments come from, and how the firewall
// rules that protect them are spelled.
//
// This is arithmetic and string building — no sockets, no syscalls, no build
// tag — for the same reason pckframe.go is: the decisions made here are the ones
// worth asserting on in a test, and a test that only runs on Linux is a test
// that mostly does not run. What needs a packet socket lives in
// pckconn_linux.go; what needs iptables lives in pckguard_linux.go.

// pckPortSpan is how many consecutive source ports one client tunnel may use:
// one per carrier, since each KCP session must reach the server as its own peer.
// The pool is configurable and allowed to grow past its configured size, so the
// range is comfortably larger than any pool anyone would run; ports wrap within
// it rather than escaping, so the guard's range always covers what is in use.

// pckPortSeq hands out the offset within that range. One tunnel runs per
// process, so a package-level counter is exactly the right scope.

// pckClientPortBase derives the bottom of the client's source-port range from
// the tunnel token.
//
// Deriving the range rather than picking it at random is what keeps the
// kernel-suppression rules to one set for the tunnel's life. The rules are
// written against the port range, so a range that changed on every reconnect
// would leave a new set behind each time — and on a flaky link, where reconnects
// are the whole point of this transport, they would accumulate until something
// noticed. It also means a middlebox watching the pair sees the same flows
// resume rather than a new set appear.
//
// What is NOT derived is which port within the range a given carrier takes: see
// newPckConn for why they must differ.
