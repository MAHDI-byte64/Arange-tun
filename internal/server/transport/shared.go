// authorizeWSRequest checks the Authorization header on a websocket upgrade.
//
// Over plain ws there is no session to bind to, so the header carries the token
// itself and is compared to the configured one. Over wss the client sends a
// proof bound to the TLS session instead of the token, and the server recomputes
// the expected proof from its own side of that session; a man in the middle that
// terminated the client's TLS holds a different session and cannot produce it.
// Either way the comparison is constant time, and a wss connection whose keying
// material cannot be exported is rejected rather than waved through.
//
// simpleAuth turns the binding off and compares the raw token even over TLS.
// That is exactly what the binding exists to prevent — anyone who terminates
// the TLS then sees a token they could replay — so it is off by default. It is
// here for one deployment the binding otherwise makes impossible: a TLS
// terminating reverse proxy in front of the tunnel, NGINX being the usual one.
// There the proxy legitimately holds a different TLS session from the client,
// so a bound proof can never match; the operator who puts a trusted proxy there
// is choosing to trust it with the token, which is the same thing the raw ws
// transport already does.
