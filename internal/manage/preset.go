// Performance presets.
//
// A preset is a single choice that fills every tuning knob of a tunnel —
// buffers, pool sizes, mux windows and (for KCP) the retransmission and FEC
// settings. The same three presets apply to every transport, so the answer to
// "how hard should this tunnel push?" is the same question everywhere.
//
// Upgrade note: a preset is applied once, when a tunnel is created or when the
// operator picks "Change performance preset". The numbers are written into the
// tunnel's config file, and an update replaces only the binary — it never
// rewrites a config. So changing the values here cannot disturb a tunnel that
// already exists: it keeps the numbers on its disk until somebody deliberately
// re-applies a preset. New tunnels get the current values, and a config with no
// preset field at all is left exactly as it is.

	//
	// Balance, Turbo and Aggressive are all gaming profiles: they differ only in
	// how much headroom they buy, and every one of them spends bandwidth to hold
	// the ping steady — immediate ACKs, a 10 ms tick, and enough parity to repair
	// a lost packet rather than wait a round trip for it to be resent. That is
	// the right trade for a game and the wrong one for a download, and no amount
	// of tuning inside those three fixes it, because the cost is the point.
	//
	// This preset makes the opposite trade on the same transport: batch the ACKs,
	// tick half as often, carry a tenth as much parity, and open the window wide
	// enough that one stream can actually fill a long fat path. It is for the
	// operator who wants the tunnel to move data quickly and is not measuring
	// their ping while it does.

	// It is offered on the KCP family only. On a TCP-based transport every knob
