// The client half of the control handshake.
//
// A pool connection used to prove nothing: the server accepted it because its
// source address matched the control channel's. The client now asks for a nonce
// instead, and presents it on every pool connection — see network.PoolNonce for
// why the address was the wrong thing to judge by.
//
// Asking is a new signal rather than a flag inside the old one, which makes the
// negotiation trivial in one direction and cheap in the other. A server that
// already speaks it answers with the nonce. A server that does not never
// recognises the signal and closes the connection, and the client notices that
// and drops back to the old handshake for the rest of the process. The cost of
// meeting an old server is one failed connection attempt, once.

// controlAckTimeout is how long to wait for the server's answer to the
// handshake.
//
// It was two seconds, which is the kind of number that works everywhere it is
// tested and then does not: it has to cover a round trip plus whatever the
// server takes to answer, and on a long or lossy path — which is the ordinary
// case for this tunnel, not the exceptional one — a retransmitted SYN alone can
// eat most of it. There is nothing to gain from failing fast here, because
// failing means backing off and dialling again, which costs far more than
// waiting a few seconds longer would have.

// error immediately; a filtered or broken path times out instead. Treating a
// timeout as evidence of an old server would give up the nonce for the life of
// the process over a momentary outage.
