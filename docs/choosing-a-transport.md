# Choosing a transport (Link Test)

Not sure which transport suits your route? Let Arange-tun measure it.

## Run the test

On the **abroad (kharej)** server, go to **Manage → Link Test**. It measures
latency, jitter and packet loss **over TCP** — never ICMP, because many networks
on this route drop ping while carrying tunnel traffic perfectly well. It then:

- recommends a transport and explains **why**, and
- offers to derive the liveness timers from your real round trip instead of the
  fixed defaults.

## The short version

| Situation | Use |
|-----------|-----|
| The route loses packets | **UDP + KCP** — repairs loss with forward error correction |
| The link is clean | **TCP Mux** |
| You need to look like a browser loading HTTPS | **WSS** — sends a real Chrome TLS fingerprint |
| The connection itself is being filtered | **TCP + Stealth** — encrypted with no fingerprint at all |

**KCP runs over UDP** — if your provider filters UDP, it will not help; pick a
TCP-based transport instead.

## The families

- **TCP** — reliable stream. `TCP Mux` runs many streams over one connection;
  `TCP + Stealth` wraps it in a Noise layer with no fingerprint.
- **UDP** — datagrams. `UDP + KCP` adds reliable delivery + FEC.
- **WebSocket** — looks like web traffic. `WSS` / `WSS Mux` add TLS with a
  browser fingerprint and bind the credential to the TLS session.
